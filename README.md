# LOWbang: Buy-in Reccomendations for Retail Investors
Disclaimer: This project is for educational and informational purposes only. The outputs generated by LOWbang do not constitute financial advice, investment recommendations, or an offer to buy or sell any securities. All calculations are based on simplified assumptions and external data sources, and users should conduct their own research or consult a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.

# Overview
LOWbang is a Python-based web application designed to help retail investors identify potential stock entry ranges using transparent valuation logic and volatility-adjusted assumptions. The goal is not to predict prices, but to provide an interpretable framework that allows users to understand why a stock may be considered attractively priced within a certain range. This project brings together concepts from equity analysis, volatility, web scraping, and basic product design.

# Key Features
- Input validation to filter out invalid or incorrect ticker symbols
- Automated data retrieval through web scraping
- Volatility-adjusted entry range calculations
- Web-based interface for improved readability and usability
- End-to-end pipeline from input to displayed results
- Design Decisions and Reflections
- User Interface and Automation

The initial version of LOWbang ran entirely in a Python terminal. This iteration introduces a web-based interface to improve readability, convenience, and user experience. Automating the workflow also makes the analysis clearer and more accessible.

# Data Sourcing Tradeoffs

The first version manually scraped raw financial values and performed all calculations internally. To improve efficiency, the current version retrieves values from external sources that already implement similar valuation models. This reduces complexity but introduces reliance on external calculations, which is a conscious tradeoff.

Market Price Constraints; Live market prices could not be reliably scraped due to frequently changing HTML structures. As a result, the application uses the previous closing price, which remains a stable and reasonable proxy for valuation purposes.

# Core Assumptions

- A fixed 20 percent margin of safety is assumed for retail investors
- Implied volatility is incorporated but scaled by a factor of 0.5 to reflect the view that markets do not always fully price in volatility in the short term
- These assumptions are simplifications and are explicitly stated to ensure transparency.

# What I Learned

This project represents an integration of the techniques I have been self-learning, including Python, web scraping, financial modelling, and basic product design. Seeing these ideas come together into a working application has been both motivating and instructive, and it has encouraged me to continue building and iterating on similar projects.
